on:
  push:
    # Pattern matched against refs/tags
    tags:
    - "**"  # Push events to every tag including tags with slashes

# How to publish a new version:
# 1. Update all hardcoded versions in this file (automation TBD): plugin's, Airflow's, and Python's ones.
#    Pick the latest Airflow's and Python's versions supported by the plugin.
# 2. Publish a tag with a name equal to the plugin's current version and "v" prefix: e.g. v1.0.0.
